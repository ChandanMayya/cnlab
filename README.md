# Computer Networks Lab

# Part A 
_Implement the following Computer Networks concepts using C/C++_
1. Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission.
2. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make the client send the file name
and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.
3. Write a program for Hamming code generation for error detection and correction.
4. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.

# Part B
_Simulate the following Computer Networks concepts using any network simulators_
1. Simulate a three nodes point — to — point network with duplex links between them. Set the
queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
2. Simulate the network with five nodes n0, n1, n2, n3, n4, forming a star topology. The node n4
is at the centre. Node n0 is a TCP source, which transmits packets to node n3 (a TCP sink)
through the node n4. Node n1 is another traffic source, and sends UDP packets to node n2
through n4. The duration of the simulation time is 10 seconds.
3. Simulate to study transmission of packets over Ethernet LAN and determine the number of
packets drop destination.
4. Simulate working of multicasting routing protocol and analyse the throughput of the
network/protocol.
5. Simulate the different types of internet traffic such as FTP and TELNET over a wired network
and analyze the packet drop and packet delivery ratio in the network.
